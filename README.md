Vertigo is a frantic, real-time action game that puts you in the pilot seat of a helicopter (if you so choose). Shoot your way through 10 varied scenarios, whether it be in the air or on foot. Break windows, defuse bombs, even airfight bogeys - whatever it takes, complete your mission! 

*Feel every hit. When you're on foot, it only takes one shot to end your life. 

*Easy to learn, hard to master: you'll be fighting your own flying skills more than you will be the enemy. 

*Addictive and replay-able, letting you experiment in your approach to any objective. 

*Infiltrate towers, avoiding helicopter gunfire in the same way your enemies once evaded your own.
